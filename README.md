So far the script only works for ubuntu.
For automatic launch of the generated html file you need to have chrome (google-chrome-stable) installed on your ubuntu system.
Grab a link for a NYT article:
run ```node script.js``` in the terminal and paste the link when prompted. The full free article will be launched on a chrome tab with no paywall!
Only been worked on for a day, more functionality and better css formatting for the articles will be implemented soon.
